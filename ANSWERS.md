- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

ComponentDidMount is called once the basic framework is loaded and can be manipulated by side effects.
Render is when the created class is applied to the DOM.

Helps find bugs faster, makes you consider edge cases, acts as documentation and a safety net, teaches to write 'better' more testable code.
